# Implementing Project Details

- [x] Create server actions for `superstructures` (create, update, delete)
- [x] Create server actions for `project_accessories` (create, update, delete)
- [x] Create `AddSuperstructureModal` and `AddAccessoryModal` components
- [x] Update `ProjectDetailClient` to display these lists and include "Add" buttons
- [x] Update `UpdateProjectModal` to remove legacy fields if necessary (or keep them sync)
- [x] Verify everything works
